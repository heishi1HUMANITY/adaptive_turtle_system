# Frontend Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

The frontend application connects to a backend API. Ensure the backend server is running (typically at `http://localhost:8000`) for full functionality. It fetches an API status from `/api/health` on the backend.
