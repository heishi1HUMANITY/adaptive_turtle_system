# Backend API

This directory contains the backend API for the application, built with FastAPI.

## Purpose

The backend system serves as the central logic and data processing unit for the application. It handles incoming requests from the frontend, interacts with data sources, performs business logic, and returns appropriate responses. Its primary goal is to provide a reliable and efficient interface for the frontend to consume.

## Key Features and Functionalities

*   **User Authentication:** Securely manages user login and session management. (Assumption: This is a common feature)
*   **Data Processing:** Handles creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion (CRUD) of data. (Assumption: This is a common feature)
*   **Business Logic:** Implements core application logic and workflows.
*   **API Endpoints:** Exposes a set of well-defined endpoints for frontend interaction.
*   **Scalability:** Designed to handle a growing number of users and requests. (General good practice)

## API Endpoints

This section details the available API endpoints.

### GET /api/health
- **Description**: Checks the health of the backend server.
- **Request Body**: None
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "ok"
  }
  ```
*(Further endpoints will be documented here as they are identified or developed).*

## Interactions

The backend system primarily interacts with the following:

*   **Frontend Application:** Responds to API requests from the user interface, providing data and executing actions as requested.
*   **Database:** Stores and retrieves application data (e.g., user profiles, application-specific data). (Assumption: Most backends have a database)
*   **External Services (Optional):** May connect to third-party services for functionalities like payment processing, email notifications, etc. (General possibility)

## Setup and Running

### 1. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the FastAPI development server using the provided shell script. Ensure you are in the `backend` directory:

```bash
bash start_backend.sh
```
Alternatively, if you have made the script executable (`chmod +x start_backend.sh`):
```bash
./start_backend.sh
```

This script will start the server at `http://0.0.0.0:8000` (accessible on your local machine and potentially from other devices on the same network). The server uses `--reload` for auto-reloading when code changes are detected.

### Running on Windows (PowerShell)
If you are on Windows, you can use the PowerShell script from within the `backend` directory:
```powershell
.\start_backend.ps1
```
Make sure your execution policy allows running local scripts (e.g., by running `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process` in PowerShell).

The API includes an endpoint `/api/health` which can be used to check if the server is running and accessible. It should return `{"status": "ok"}`.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

*   **Server Not Starting:**
    *   Ensure all dependencies in `requirements.txt` are installed correctly.
    *   Check if the port (e.g., 8000) is already in use by another application.
    *   Verify Python and FastAPI/Uvicorn versions are compatible.
*   **API Endpoint Errors:**
    *   Check the Uvicorn server logs for detailed error messages.
    *   Ensure the request format (body, parameters, headers) matches the endpoint's requirements.
    *   Verify that any required services (like a database) are running and accessible.
*   **`ImportError`:**
    *   Make sure you are in the `backend` directory when running the `start_backend.sh` or `start_backend.ps1` script.
    *   Ensure all custom modules are correctly placed and importable.
